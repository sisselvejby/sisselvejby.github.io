		<i>The Cabinet Dreams</i>
			<br><br>
		In a grey living room stood a huge cabinet. The place he had was crowded and dark. He was surrounded by other big furnitures, such as a heavy table with six heavy chairs, a fake chandelier made of plastic and a huge red even more heavy couch. All of these furnitures were pretending to be made of wood and fancy materials, decorated in dark coloured fabric. In the end of the room a small window was placed, and sometimes the light from the outside would sneak in through the small holes of the curtains. This was his favorite time at day. Feeling the yellow lighted spots, was as heartwarming as looking at the poster on the other side of the room. 

			The poster, which had been hanging there as long as he could remember, was of this dreamy place, with beautiful palm trees, sunlight all day long and white soft sand that he could almost feel under his plastic feet when he was having his daily daydream about the place of the poster on the wall. Oh, and how the warm breeze coming from the clear blue sea would tinkle him in all the places fresh air never would reach.

			His daydream was suddently interrupted by the Russian woman collecting her way to expensive glasses imported from the Czech Republic. She was banging the closetdoors not caring at all for the big cabinet. When she started moving around the glasses the dust started twirling in the air. Before the cabinet new it the dust had found a new and better place to rest in the cracks of the cabinet. He drew a deep sigh and thought to himself, oh how much he would give to change this position of his, since beginning of time. 

			He did not care about the fancy glass, he did not care about the porcelain animals, he did not care about the pictures of the people he never saw, he even did not care about the big stereo that was always playing from ten in the morning till’ ten in the evening. The only thing he cared about was the poster on the wall. 

			As time passed by, the woman and her family became less and less careful treating the cabinet with no respect. One day his closest neighbour, the big red couch, was replaced by a slim, sleek and black newer model. He knew the clock, on his shelf, was ticking. 

			One especially grey day two unfamiliar women came into his living room. He had not seen them before, and could not recognize them from any portraits. But the women was very interested in him. They  carefully began to disassemble him, they investegated every single screw and board, never had he had such affection. 

			They began to carry him outside, and for the first time he was covered in sun and light. The women brought him to the warehouse at the port, and as he thought he was gonna see the water he was braught back into the dark. In the shadows he was lying on the cold cement-floor, and fell into a deep coma.

			Being in the coma he dreamt about the poster, the place he would never see again. But as he opened his eyes it was even better than before. He was in a magical place with air, water and sun, and his body had been transformed into his dream beach-body surrounded by disain students from all over the world. 
			COOL!
